Behavioral Design Patterns

This type of design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects,
how to provide lose coupling, and flexibility to extend easily in future.

Pattern Name	Description

Chain of Resp.	Used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.
Command	        Command Pattern is used to implement lose coupling in a request-response model.
Interpreter	    Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
Iterator	    Used to provide a standard way to traverse through a group of Objects.
Mediator	    Used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.
Memento	        The Memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on.
Observer	    Useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.
State	        State design pattern is used when an Object change it’s behavior based on it’s internal state.
Strategy	    Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.
Template Method	Used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.
Visitor	        Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.
